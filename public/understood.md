Sure! The useEffect hook in React is used to handle side effects in functional components. Side effects include data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM in React components. The useEffect hook runs after every render, but you can control when it runs by providing a dependency array.

Basic Syntax
javascript
Copy code
useEffect(() => {
  // Your side effect logic here

  return () => {
    // Optional cleanup logic here
  };
}, [dependencies]);
The first argument is a function that contains the side effect.
The second argument is an optional array of dependencies. The effect runs after each render if the dependencies have changed. If the array is empty, the effect runs only once after the initial render.
